# MLSDFinal
 Machine Learning and Systems Design Final Project; Deepfake Generation


This project uses simple one factor GAN to create a deepfake model from an image input. TBD if I will upload a picture of my face as a demo before I ask the user for input.

The first step is loading a pretrained model and using it on a picture of my face.

Then I will ask the user to input a face and go from there with the same model. I will use the same sample video to attach the face. That way you can directly compare the results.
